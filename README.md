# oslc-server
An OSLC Server Node.js app

oslc-server is a Bluemix Node.js app that uses the oslc-service Express.js middleware module to provide an OSLC server that supports any domain.

oslc-server exploits the dynamic and asynchronous capabilities of JavaScript and Node.js to build an OSLC server that can easily adapt to any OSLC domain, extensions to domains, and/or integrations between domains, and can be easily adapted to provide OSLC access to existing data sources.
